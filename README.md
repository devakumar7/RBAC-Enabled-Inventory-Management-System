Title: "RBAC-Enhanced Inventory Management System with Advanced Data Relationships and Automated Invoicing"

Description:
Our project is an Inventory Management System that incorporates Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to regulate user access. Beyond RBAC, we've implemented sophisticated one-to-many and many-to-one mapping for parent-child table relationships. This ensures seamless management of entities like inventory, customers, sellers, and orders, allowing for a detailed and structured data management approach.

In addition to RBAC and advanced data relationships, our system offers an automated invoicing feature. When an order is successfully placed, the system generates an invoice automatically. This feature streamlines the billing process, reduces errors, and enhances customer satisfaction by providing accurate and timely invoices. Our comprehensive solution represents a powerful tool for businesses seeking efficient, secure, and automated inventory management with role-based access control.
