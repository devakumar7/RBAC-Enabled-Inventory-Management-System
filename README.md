Our project is an Inventory Management System designed to streamline operations involving inventory, customers, sellers, and orders. We've implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure secure and controlled access to various system features. With RBAC, users are assigned specific roles (e.g., admin, manager, staff) that determine their level of access and permissions within the system. This enhances data security, simplifies user management, and ensures that only authorized personnel can perform specific actions, such as adding products, processing orders, or managing customer accounts. Our RBAC-enabled system offers a robust solution for businesses seeking efficient and secure inventory management.
